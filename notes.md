* Basic Shell Commands

* Listing the contents of a directory

To list the contents of a directory use the 'ls' command. On Windows you can also use the 'dir' command.

ls . - Lists the contents of the current directory
ls .. - Lists the contents of the parent directory
ls ./path/to/directory - Lists the contents of the named directory

* Changing Directory

To navigate to a different directory, use the cd (change directory) command

cd .. - Move up to the parent directory
cd ../.. - Move up to the grandparent directory
cd ./path/to/directory - Move to the named directory relative to your current directory
cd /absolute/path/to/directory - Move to the named directory regardless of your current directory

* Important Directories

When navigating the file system there are 2 important directories to be aware of;

"/" represents the root directory. Every directory path starts from here
"~" represents the home directory. Most of your personal folders will start from here
