4. Write a program that takes a string input from the user and prints it in reverse.
5. Create a script that prompts the user for their favorite color and then displays a message that says, "Your favorite color is [color]!".
6. Write a Python program that takes two input strings and prints them concatenated together.
7. Ask the user for a temperature in Celsius and convert it to Fahrenheit, displaying the result.

### 3. **Loops and Branching Logic**

1. Write a program that prints all numbers from 1 to 50, but prints “Fizz” for multiples of 3, “Buzz” for multiples of 5, and “FizzBuzz” for multiples of both.
2. Create a loop that asks the user for a number and prints the sum of all numbers entered until the user types 0.
3. Write a program that asks the user for a number and prints whether it is prime or not.
4. Create a program that takes a number as input and prints the factorial of that number.
5. Write a program that asks the user to input a password and continues to ask until the correct password is entered.
6. Write a script that prints all even numbers between 1 and 100 using a loop.
7. Write a program that asks the user for a number and prints its multiplication table up to 10.
8. Create a program that simulates a simple login system, where the user has 3 attempts to enter the correct password.
9. Write a Python script that calculates the sum of all numbers between 1 and a user-specified value, but only adds numbers divisible by 3.
10. Create a nested loop that prints a multiplication table (from 1 to 10).

### 4. **Writing to Files**

1. Write a program that asks the user for a message and writes it to a file called `message.txt`.
2. Create a program that writes the numbers 1 to 20 to a file, each number on a new line.
3. Write a script that takes a list of names and writes them to a file called `names.txt`.
4. Create a program that asks the user for their name, age, and favorite color, then saves this information to a file called `info.txt`.
5. Write a Python script that appends the current date and time to a file called `log.txt`.
6. Write a program that creates a text file and writes a user-specified number of random numbers between 1 and 100 to it.
7. Create a program that reads the content of a file called `input.txt` and writes the content in reverse order to a new file called `output.txt`.
8. Write a script that reads a list of integers from a file, doubles each one, and writes the new list to a different file.
9. Write a Python script that asks the user to input lines of text and writes them to a file. The program should stop taking input when the user types "STOP".
10. Create a program that reads from a file `data.txt`, adds 5 to each number (assuming the file contains one number per line), and writes the result to `output.txt`.

### 5. **Defining Functions**

1. Write a function `greet(name)` that takes a person's name as an argument and prints "Hello, [name]!".
2. Create a function `add(a, b)` that takes two numbers as arguments and returns their sum.
3. Write a function `is_even(n)` that returns `True` if the input number is even and `False` if it is odd.
4. Define a function `factorial(n)` that takes a positive integer `n` and returns its factorial.
5. Write a function `find_max(lst)` that takes a list of numbers as an argument and returns the largest number.
6. Create a function `reverse_string(s)` that takes a string and returns the string in reverse order.
